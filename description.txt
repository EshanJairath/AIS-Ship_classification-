This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict the type of ship in the Kattegat Strait region, based on its characteristics such as width, length, course, and speed. The dataset used is derived from the open source AIS information provided by Denmark Maritime Authority (DMA), covering a period between 1 Jan 2022 to 10 Mar 2022. The project aims to develop an accurate classification model that can help in identifying ships in the region based on their features, which could have potential applications in areas such as maritime security, vessel traffic management, and environmental monitoring.
